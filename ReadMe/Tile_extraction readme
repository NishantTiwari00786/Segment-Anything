GeoTIFF Tiling Utility
  Description
    This utility extracts fixed-size tiles from GeoTIFF files, suitable for further processing in GIS applications or machine learning models. It processes all GeoTIFF files in a specified directory and outputs the tiles to another directory.

Requirements
  Python 3.x
  Rasterio library

Installation
  Install the required Python package:
    pip install rasterio

Inputs
  Directory Path: Directory containing the GeoTIFF files to be processed.
    Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/US_BASEMAP
Output Directory: Directory where the extracted tiles will be saved.
    Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/US_BASEMAP_TILE
Tile Size: Dimensions of the tiles in pixels. Default is 256x256 pixels.
  Hop Size: Step size for moving the window across the image. Default is 256x256 pixels (non-overlapping tiles).
  Outputs
  Extracted tiles are saved in the output directory, named using the format: output_{row}_{column}_{originalFileName}.tif.

Usage
Adjust the paths and tile/hop sizes as needed in the script. Run the script to process all GeoTIFF files in the specified directory.

Process Flow
  Verifies existence or creates the output directory.
  Processes each GeoTIFF file in the specified directory:
  For each file, tiles are extracted based on the defined tile and hop sizes.
  Each tile is saved with its position and base file name.
  Outputs total number of tiles generated.
Conclusion
  This utility streamlines the extraction of uniform tiles from larger GeoTIFF files, facilitating data preparation tasks for various applications including spatial analysis and training machine learning models.

SAM Image Segmentation Project
  Overview
    This project utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) powered by a Vision Transformer (ViT-H) to perform image segmentation. It supports generating masks based on specific points or automatically for the entire image. The resulting masks are visualized and saved for further analysis.

Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
  OpenCV (opencv-python)
  NumPy
  Matplotlib
  Pillow
  Torchvision
  The segment-anything module, including the SAM model and utilities

Installation
  Install the required libraries using pip:
  pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib Pillow torchvision

Configuration
  Model Path: Path to the SAM model weights.
    Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/SAM weights/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
  Image Path: Path to the input image for segmentation.
    Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/output_256_1024_328-1343_quad.tif
  Output Directory: Directory to store the output masks and processed images.
    Example: /Users/nishanttiwari/Desktop/OPEN_CV_SAM_OUTPUT

Features
  Point-Based Segmentation: Generate masks at specified coordinates within the image.
  Automatic Full Image Segmentation: Automatically produce masks for significant visual features across the entire image.
  Visualization: Display and save the segmented masks alongside the original image.
  Combined Mask Application: Apply a combined version of all generated masks to the original image and save the result.

Usage
  Set the image and model paths in the script to your specific setup.
  Execute the script to process the image and generate masks, which are saved and visualized.

Output  
  Individual masks are saved as PNG files in the specified output directory.
  The combined mask is applied to the original image, saved as a JPG file.
  The script also displays the original image overlaid with mask contours and optional confidence scores.

Running the Script
  Run the script from your Python environment:
  python segment_image.py

Conclusion
  This utility provides a robust tool for image segmentation using state-of-the-art machine learning models, suitable for academic, industrial, or personal projects involving image analysis.
